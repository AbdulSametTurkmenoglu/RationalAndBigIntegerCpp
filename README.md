## RationalAndBigIntegerCpp

This repository contains two C++ projects:

Rasyonel: A class for rational number operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, comparison) with fraction simplification.

MS: A class for arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation).

Both classes use operator overloading and are designed for educational purposes.

# Usage

Clone the repository.

Compile main.cpp files using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

Run the executables to test rational and big integer operations.

# Notes
- Built with C++ for learning and demonstration.

- Includes basic error handling and operator overloading.
